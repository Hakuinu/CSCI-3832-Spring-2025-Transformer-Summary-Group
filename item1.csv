Review
"All flavors are great except the regular cola one. It’s not bad but lacking taste. Love the cream soda and root beer."
"I absolutely love Zevia Ginger Ale! I buy them every single week (or every other week) because I seriously can’t get enough. Finally found this pack on Amazon for the best price I’ve seen anywhere—total game-changer. The flavor is super refreshing, and it totally hits the spot when I’m craving soda, but without all the bad stuff regular soda has. No sugar, no weird ingredients—just clean, fizzy goodness. I’m completely obsessed and will definitely be reordering. Highly recommend if you’re trying to cut out traditional soda but still want something tasty"
"Love this drink with a little squeeze of lemon. Other people I have shared this with enjoy the squeeze of lemon as well. I just buy lemon in the bottle to make it easy. I takes away any of the stevia aftertaste that can exist. Love the fact that Zevia comes without the caffeine as well. Gives me a lot of comfort while trying to be more healthy."
"I have written a lot of reviews and can't remember leaving a bad one.........until now. These are absolutely the grossest tasting drinks I have ever had the misfortune of allowing beyond my lips. I got the variety pack and have tasted each one thinking if only ONE was a hit, it might be worth the price.  Let me make it clear that NONE of them are even remotely flavorful. All of them have a chemical taste that is immediately detectable. If that is not bad enough, they also leave a bitter aftertaste that lingers for a LONG time. I honestly compare them to some sort of medicine that I would tell my doctor I'm not taking again! Now I have all of these cans of this crap that I don't know what to do with. I can't give them to friends because I wouldn't have them anymore if I did. Trust me guys, look elsewhere. These are unbelievably bad!"
"Too bad it wasn't out of six stars so I could give it one star out of six. The black cherry was the only flavor that I actually enjoyed. The vanilla cola came close which is funny because I don't really like cola. The other four are nasty. The only other redeeming quality is that it was a variety pack so I could learn with just one purchase that I don't really like this brand of soda. If they sell black cherry separately I might actually purchase a batch but never any other flavor from them."
"There is nothing ""cola"" about the cola flavor. It tastes nothing like Pepsi, Coke, Diet versions, store brand generics, etc. This is one of the worst sparkling beverages I have ever drank. I think I would rather drink a 12 oz bottle of lemon-lime magnesium citrate (colonoscopy prep anyone?)."
"The soda is wonderful and I now order 4 cases a month. HOWEVER. THE PACKING IS HORRIBLE AND THE LAST 2 CASES LOOKED LINE THEY WERE TOSSED IN A BOX AND THE CARDBOARD CASES WERE TOSSED ON TOP. 6 OF THR CANS HAD SUCH A BAD DENT IN THE BOTTOM THEY HAVE TO BE STORED UPSIDE DOWN. Fix the shipping and this is a 5 star product."
"This cream soda is delicious but beware of packaging because one can was almost empty and the low box and plastic wrapping it was banged up. I suggest just buying it at a brick and morter store like walmart."
"I've been looking for a tasty cola that does not contain aspertame. This drink does not meet these standards. Tasty it is not. I tried to drink it and served it to four family members. They all disliked it. Zevia gets two stars though because it is an effective cleaner when it is mixed with baking soda."
"While these are drinkable, they suffer from a pronounced core flavor that's basically the same for all the ones I've tried so far, and all with a taste far weaker than most soda. For those looking for a stevia-based cola that actually tastes like one, try Green Cola."
"Not Cola. Tasty and no sugar but no way does it taste like cola. I won’t order again. But I’ll enjoy it even though I’m a big fan of Rum with Cherry Coke."
"Standard size. Nice and carbonated and fizzy. Smells like stevia and soda. Tastes good. I bought these because I was drinking too much diet coke, and diet coke makes me more hungry. I didn't have that issue with these Zevias. Only thing is that Stevia can leave a bit of a bitter aftertaste, but I don't mind it too much. It helps to drink these super cold, straight out of the fridge."
