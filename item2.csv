Review
"Not bad for the size, the chips are good, good taste indeed. Better for me for the value for money and it's not so greasiness. It's much healthy when the chips are not so greasy."
"I have never ordered chips online but case arrived and only a few were a bit crunched otherwise bags arrived in great shape! The chips themselves are AMAZING!!! Finally a safe chip and cheddar sour cream flavored without the junk but still delicious!!!!"
"I love these chips. They taste great. You can taste the salt which I like. Good value for money. Good quality chip and they were fresh. Not super greasy either."
"These are my absolute favorite chips. I love the different flavors also. Avocado oil FTW"
"Stale. Delivered on March 25 and Best Buy date Match 24. Tasted awful. I give zero stars."
"Gross dripping oily. Soggy, yuck."
"All broken chips. This is a Non-Returnable item, so think twice before purchasing"
"Box arrived squished in on the sides. Fifty percent of the chips where broken. Suggest a stronger box and/or print ""fragile"" on the box. Broken or not, I still ate the chips because they have a good crunch. Not the chips' fault but more the shipping process."
"I used to regularly buy this but now at $76.00 that will not happen anymore. This is absolutely ridciulous! If you want more people to buy this product then I advise you to lower the cost. These bags are cheaper in the grocery store. So disappointed. When you decide to lower it, I will regularly start purchasing again. These are really good but not THAT good!"
"these are okay they just feel oilly."
