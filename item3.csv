Review
"Great taste but hard to break apart the meat. I had to really get down and dirty to get it to separate. Everything else was fantastic, the taste and the fact that you can cut the blocks apart and store each pound separately really won me over."
"Good product and priced accordingly! Recommend!"
"1st time using Amazon fresh and it's a wonderful service. All the food I purchased was fresh and tasted delicious. The ground beef was used to make hamburger and chilli. The beef was delicious with no complaints. I will definitely be using this service more because it's so convenient. After working 50 plus hours a week and arthritis in a bad knee sometimes it's to hard to go to the market and shop for food and walk up and down steps to my apartment to bring my food in. Delivery service was Awesome and you pick the time frame for delivery and the driver brought my stuff in and walked up the 3 steps to my apartment. Just Awesome and Amazing. Thank you so much for this service. It was just so helpful for me."
"I bought so much of this product because it was on sale. Meet prices are so outrageous right now in the United States. I was so worried about how I was gonna feed my family. Turns out this was an excellent and on sale very cheapriced. Very much worth it very much worth buying multiple. If it ever goes on sale again at that price I will buy I believe I ended up buying 23 packs"
"Extremely fatty. I get it an 80/20 cut but it seems like more like 40/60. I don’t know if I got a bad pack, but 0/10 would not recommend."
"Very high fat content greater than 20% and more like 50%! I broiled hamburger patties made from this meat and the hamburgers shrunk to about half their size, made a large puddle of grease and looked like medium large round meatballs. Cooked well done, but they still taste like sawdust soaked with fat. Not sure if I should eat it because of all that fat. I am very disappointed Amazon - you could do better than this, but you get away with selling faulty food products because of the no return/no refund policy."
"I weighed every one of these square packages of meat. And every single one of them was off by .5oz. I bought 15lbs of meat that’s a total of 7.5 oz of meat that I was short changed. I tried to give Amazon the benefit of the doubt. I calibrated my food scale and even weighed other brands to make sure. And every time your brand was off. It might not seem like much but Americans are struggling right now. And if you’re doing this to everyone you are saving and we are losing on something we PAID for. I liked the meat but I am very disappointed in the dishonesty."
"This beef has parts that don't dissolve in our mouth and we have to spit it out. It's gross. Fake meat maybe?"
"What a very good value for the price! I kept the separately package one-pound packages in the freezer for weeks. They were fine in terms of freshness, but are greasy -- I air-fried one pount made into meat balls. More than 2 tablespoons of clear grease was captured. I might consider leaner meat for the future."
"We’ve ordered this a few times because the of the value ($6 for three lbs of beef is pretty good). However, the last time the sell by date was two days before the delivery day. Not a good practice for a grocery carrier to be doing. Wouldn’t chance eating past due meat"
