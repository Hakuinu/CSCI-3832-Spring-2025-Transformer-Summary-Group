# CSCI-3832-Spring-2025-Transformer-Summary-Group
Project for CSCI 3832 Spring 2025 involving making a transformer model to perform summarization based on the overall reviews of food items from Amazon.

Our 3 main models are the RNN, BART, and T5 models.

To run the BART model download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews and move the kagglehub/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews/versions/2/Reviews.csv into the same directory as the notebook.
