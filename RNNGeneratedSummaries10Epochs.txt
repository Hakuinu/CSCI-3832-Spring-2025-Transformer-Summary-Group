Original Review: I absolutely love Zevia Ginger Ale! I buy them every single week (or every other week) because I seriously can’t get enough. Finally found this pack on Amazon for the best price I’ve seen anywhere—total game-changer. The flavor is super refreshing, and it totally hits the spot when I’m craving soda, but without all the bad stuff regular soda has. No sugar, no weird ingredients—just clean, fizzy goodness. I’m completely obsessed and will definitely be reordering. Highly recommend if you’re trying to cut out traditional soda but still want something tasty

Original Review: Love this drink with a little squeeze of lemon. Other people I have shared this with enjoy the squeeze of lemon as well. I just buy lemon in the bottle to make it easy. I takes away any of the stevia aftertaste that can exist. Love the fact that Zevia comes without the caffeine as well. Gives me a lot of comfort while trying to be more healthy.

Original Review: I have written a lot of reviews and can't remember leaving a bad one.........until now. These are absolutely the grossest tasting drinks I have ever had the misfortune of allowing beyond my lips. I got the variety pack and have tasted each one thinking if only ONE was a hit, it might be worth the price.  Let me make it clear that NONE of them are even remotely flavorful. All of them have a chemical taste that is immediately detectable. If that is not bad enough, they also leave a bitter aftertaste that lingers for a LONG time. I honestly compare them to some sort of medicine that I would tell my doctor I'm not taking again! Now I have all of these cans of this crap that I don't know what to do with. I can't give them to friends because I wouldn't have them anymore if I did. Trust me guys, look elsewhere. These are unbelievably bad!

Original Review: Too bad it wasn't out of six stars so I could give it one star out of six. The black cherry was the only flavor that I actually enjoyed. The vanilla cola came close which is funny because I don't really like cola. The other four are nasty. The only other redeeming quality is that it was a variety pack so I could learn with just one purchase that I don't really like this brand of soda. If they sell black cherry separately I might actually purchase a batch but never any other flavor from them.

Original Review: There is nothing "cola" about the cola flavor. It tastes nothing like Pepsi, Coke, Diet versions, store brand generics, etc. This is one of the worst sparkling beverages I have ever drank. I think I would rather drink a 12 oz bottle of lemon-lime magnesium citrate (colonoscopy prep anyone?).

Original Review: The soda is wonderful and I now order 4 cases a month. HOWEVER. THE PACKING IS HORRIBLE AND THE LAST 2 CASES LOOKED LINE THEY WERE TOSSED IN A BOX AND THE CARDBOARD CASES WERE TOSSED ON TOP. 6 OF THR CANS HAD SUCH A BAD DENT IN THE BOTTOM THEY HAVE TO BE STORED UPSIDE DOWN. Fix the shipping and this is a 5 star product.

Original Review: I've been looking for a tasty cola that does not contain aspertame. This drink does not meet these standards. Tasty it is not. I tried to drink it and served it to four family members. They all disliked it. Zevia gets two stars though because it is an effective cleaner when it is mixed with baking soda.

Original Review: While these are drinkable, they suffer from a pronounced core flavor that's basically the same for all the ones I've tried so far, and all with a taste far weaker than most soda. For those looking for a stevia-based cola that actually tastes like one, try Green Cola.

Original Review: Standard size. Nice and carbonated and fizzy. Smells like stevia and soda. Tastes good. I bought these because I was drinking too much diet coke, and diet coke makes me more hungry. I didn't have that issue with these Zevias. Only thing is that Stevia can leave a bit of a bitter aftertaste, but I don't mind it too much. It helps to drink these super cold, straight out of the fridge.

Original Review: I used to regularly buy this but now at $76.00 that will not happen anymore. This is absolutely ridciulous!

Original Review: 1st time using Amazon fresh and it's a wonderful service. All the food I purchased was fresh and tasted delicious. The ground beef was used to make hamburger and chilli. The beef was delicious with no complaints. I will definitely be using this service more because it's so convenient. After working 50 plus hours a week and arthritis in a bad knee sometimes it's to hard to go to the market and shop for food and walk up and down steps to my apartment to bring my food in. Delivery service was Awesome and you pick the time frame for delivery and the driver brought my stuff in and walked up the 3 steps to my apartment. Just Awesome and Amazing. Thank you so much for this service. It was just so helpful for me.

Original Review: Very high fat content greater than 20% and more like 50%! I broiled hamburger patties made from this meat and the hamburgers shrunk to about half their size, made a large puddle of grease and looked like medium large round meatballs. Cooked well done, but they still taste like sawdust soaked with fat. Not sure if I should eat it because of all that fat. I am very disappointed Amazon - you could do better than this, but you get away with selling faulty food products because of the no return/no refund policy.

Original Review: I weighed every one of these square packages of meat. And every single one of them was off by .5oz. I bought 15lbs of meat that’s a total of 7.5 oz of meat that I was short changed. I tried to give Amazon the benefit of the doubt. I calibrated my food scale and even weighed other brands to make sure. And every time your brand was off. It might not seem like much but Americans are struggling right now. And if you’re doing this to everyone you are saving and we are losing on something we PAID for. I liked the meat but I am very disappointed in the dishonesty.

Original Review: What a very good value for the price! I kept the separately package one-pound packages in the freezer for weeks. They were fine in terms of freshness, but are greasy -- I air-fried one pount made into meat balls. More than 2 tablespoons of clear grease was captured. I might consider leaner meat for the future.
